  <!-- Introduction paragraph about Anoushka -->
  <p>Hi! My name is Anoushka. I'm a third year Data Science and Business Administration major with a concentration in Marketing Analytics at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. My last co-op was at Biogen, where I worked in Customer Data and Insights. Here, I worked with a lot of patient data to understand trends, changing preferences, and their perception of the medicines in order to help optimize business strategy and medical services. I'm very interested in the intersection of data with different industries, and I hope to leverage the countless opportunities data science provides for social impact and development. Outside of classes and work, I enjoy reading (especially about history), watching movies, cooking, and travelling (the last place I visited was <a href="travel.html">here</a>). Some things I want to include in the website in the future are...</p>
